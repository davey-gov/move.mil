      pro_tip: >
        <strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> There are a lot of roles in this list! That's because it takes the coordination of a lot of people to get the moves done!

- title: Schedule a Move
  tutorial_steps:
    - image_path: tutorials/schedule-a-move-01.png
      content: >
        <p>Scheduling your move is called “Self Counseling” in DPS. First, log into ETA, and choose DPS from your list of approved applications.</p>
        <p><b>Pro Tip:</b> Turn off your pop-up blocker, otherwise the DPS window won’t be able to open.</p>
    - image_path: tutorials/schedule-a-move-02.png
      content: >
        <p>On the DPS homepage, select “Self Counsel” to begin your application. <b>Pro Tip:</b> You should have a copy of your Orders, pick-up and delivery information, as well as information about your dependents and Power of Attorney if you need one.</p>
    - image_path: tutorials/schedule-a-move-03.png
      content: >
        <p>Scroll down to find the Customer Information page. During this process, if you find a blank screen, don’t worry - just scroll down to find the information you’re looking for.</p>
    - image_path: tutorials/schedule-a-move-04.png
      content: >
        <p>You’ll find an overview of the Counseling Process, but to get to the first step, you’ll need to click on the Customer Information button in the Counseling Menu on the left side of the page. <b>Pro Tip:</b> If you’ve moved before, DPS will save your information so that it’s pre-poulated here, and you won’t have to fill it out again.</p>
    - image_path: tutorials/schedule-a-move-05.png
      content: >
        <p>Fill out your Customer Information and Permanent Contact Address. The “Permanent Contact Address” is the place where you’re living right now. This information is saved in DPS so you don’t have to fill it out each time you schedule a move.</p>
        <p><b>Pro Tip:</b> You can check your progress in the Counseling Menu on the left side of the page.</p>
        <p>CONUS stands for Continental United States</p>
        <p>OCONUS stands for Outside Continental United States</p>
    - image_path: tutorials/schedule-a-move-06.png
      content: >
        <p>Enter an Emergency Contact who will be traveling or moving with you. This person will have access to shipment status, and information. <b>Pro Tip:</b> A Letter of Authorization allows you to give another person permission to act on your behalf. Only the service member who has official orders can write this letter of authorization.</p>
    - image_path: tutorials/schedule-a-move-07.png
      content: >
        <p>Here, indicate your rank, and whether or not you’re allowed PBP&E. This information allows DPS to calculate your shipment weight allowance, if it wasn’t part of your orders.</p>
        <p><b>Pro Tip:</b> PBP&E is the “pro gear” or professional equipment you might need to ship - there’s an extra separate allowance for you, and your spouse.</p>
        <p>A “Hard Copy” of your orders means that you received orders your can upload into DPS as a PDF, Word Doc, Text File, etc.</p>
    - image_path: tutorials/schedule-a-move-08.png
      content: >
        <p>Next, enter the address you are leaving, and your new address.</p>
    - image_path: tutorials/schedule-a-move-09.png
      content: >
        <p>Specify your authorized Order Type, and upload a copy of your Order document. Create your shipment based on your orders by first selecting the type. <b>Pro Tip:</b> Can’t find your type? Check out the category "Various" to see miscellaneous move types.</p>
    - image_path: tutorials/schedule-a-move-10.png
      content: >
        <p>Next, enter your new Duty Station and indicate whether or not you’re moving with dependents (including a spouse).</p>
    - image_path: tutorials/schedule-a-move-11.png
      content: >
        <p>Finally, in the Additional Information section, you’ll specify if you need to ship a POV, motorcycle, etc.</p>
        <p><b>Pro Tip:</b> A POV is your Personally Owned Vehicle, and in this context, a Mobile Home is an RV.</p>
    - image_path: tutorials/schedule-a-move-12.png
      content: >
        <p>The Order Summary allows you to review and certify the information you entered is accurate.</p>
        <p><b>Pro Tip:</b> Your weight allowance is listed here in the second paragraph.</p>
    - image_path: tutorials/schedule-a-move-13.png
      content: >
        <p>Now that you’ve entered your Orders information, you must “Create New Shipment” specific for those orders. Select the type of shipment you want to create, like “HHG,” and specify whether or not it will be a Personally Procured Move (PPM).</p>
        <p><b>Pro Tip:</b> You can create more than one type of shipment per Order. For example, you can schedule an HHG shipment for the majority of your belongings, and an additional PPM shipment for the ones you’ll move yourself in your car.</p>
    - image_path: tutorials/schedule-a-move-14.png
      content: >
        <p>Then you’ll get some helpful information about a Household Goods (HHG) move. Later on, there will be PPM specific information.</p>
    - image_path: tutorials/schedule-a-move-15.png
      content: >
        <p>Set your desired moving dates and enter the pick-up and drop off addresses.</p>
    - image_path: tutorials/schedule-a-move-16.png
      content: >
        <p>Next, define shipment weight, and let us know if you have special items like a jacuzzi or piano. There’s also a separate section for firearms on the next page.</p>
    - image_path: tutorials/schedule-a-move-17.png
      content: >
        <p>Here, indicate if you are shipping any firearms.</p>
    - image_path: tutorials/schedule-a-move-18.png
      content: >
        <p>If you have a preference, here’s where you can let us know your favorite (or least favorite) Transportation Service Provider (TSP).</p>
    - image_path: tutorials/schedule-a-move-19.png
      content: >
        <p>Now it’s time to go over moving day responsibilities for you and your TSP.</p>
    - image_path: tutorials/schedule-a-move-20.png
      content: >
        <p>A summary of your shipment is then provided.</p>
    - image_path: tutorials/schedule-a-move-21.png
      content: >
        <p>Here you’ll choose a Personal Property Office for counseling, who you’ll be in contact with after submitting your shipment through DPS. They’ll need the forms generated on the next page.</p>
    - image_path: tutorials/schedule-a-move-22.png
      content: >
        <p>On this Submit Page, review and print your forms DD1299 and DD1797, then press submit!</p>
