title: Moving Allowances (Entitlements) Overview
---

<p>Moving allowances, also known as entitlements, with the U.S. Military are largely determined based on the service member’s or civilian’s rank and dependency status. Additionally, special circumstances like a OCONUS move (moving overseas), retirement move, or separation move may have extra entitlements and/or limitations than the standard PCS (Permanent Change of Station) move within the continental United States. The <a href="http://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/Docs/perdiem/JTR.pdf">Joint Travel Regulation (JTR)</a> is the authority of entitlements for all service members, although each branch of the services may also have supplemental regulations to the JTR.</p>

<p>As questions arise, your <a href="#TODO">Transportation Office (TO)</a> can provide further information and generally is the best place to get help related to your move.</p>
