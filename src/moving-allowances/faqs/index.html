    <dt>What are the claim statuses and what do they mean?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>DPS tracks the status of each claim. While preparing a claim, its status is “In Progress.” This permits the DOD Customers to accumulate all necessary information during multiple DPS sessions and defer claim submission until everything is complete. Once the claim information is complete, the DOD Customer submits the claim. This changes the status of the claim to “Submitted.” DOD Customers or the TSP can add or modify claim information while status is “Submitted.”</p>
