title: Schedule Your Move
---

<p>Counseling is a requirement for any government move. In the past this would have been accomplished by making an appointment at your local counseling/transportation office and sitting with a personal property counselor. That was a very important process, as the counselor could explain all of your government entitlements (moves, storage, etc). They could also review the responsibilities of you, the customer, and the responsibilities of your assigned TSP (transportation service provider). With the release of DPS, you now have two options on how you complete your counseling process.</p>
<p>You can still make an appointment at your local counseling/transportation office and sit with a personal property counselor to set up your move. Alternatively, you can log into DPS and perform an online selfcounseling. DPS will review your entitlements with you and walk you through the process of setting up your move.</p>
