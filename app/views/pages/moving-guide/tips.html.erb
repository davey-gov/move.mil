      Whether this is your first move or you’re a seasoned expert… moving is stressful. While the hope would be that everything goes off without a hitch, we’ve combed service members and their families far and wide to compile some of the Top Tips to help you out.

      This list certainly is not the end all be all, but it’s a great place to start!

            If you find yourself in the midst of peak season (summer!) it can be difficult to get the dates you want for the packers and movers. History shows us <strong>the last week of the month and the last week of June/first week of July is typically the worst time to move...</strong> try for a mid-month type move. If you aren't moving during the summer time, the dates should be much easier to lock down.

            During a move you are going to need paperwork more often than you ever dreamed possible. Put together a brightly colored binder with sleeve protectors that contain copies of your orders, birth certificates, social security cards, mortgage documents, rental agreements, etc. It will make you feel even more organized than you already are.
